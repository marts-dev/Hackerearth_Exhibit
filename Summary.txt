Approach was to initially investigate the data set, then try out using the currently available features to make a regression model.
After the findings on the first approach, feature engineering it performed tp gain additional features for better result.

In terms of feature engineering, I decided to use label encoding for most of the categorical values. For the case of Transport, I decided to use
One hot encoding in order to minimize the effect of number that ay be assigned to the label.
The additional feature introduced are the State and ShipmentDiff(Difference of Schedule and Delivery date).


On both approach scaling and normalization was performed.
The result of both approach showed promising result for GradientBoostingRegressor.
