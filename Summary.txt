Approach was to initially investigate the data set, then try out using the currently available features to make a regression model.
After the findings on the first approach, feature engineering it performed tp gain additional features fpr better result.
On both approach scaling and normalization was performed.
The result of both approach showed promising result for GradientBoostingRegressor.
